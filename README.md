# edge-embedding
Skim through edge embedding and how it's adopted simultaneously with node embedding

## Starting Notion
network embedding models typically consider the
social relation between nodes as a binary variable. Accordingly,
the objective of many network embedding algorithms is to predict
the existence of edge between two nodes [14]. This objective is
sometimes extended to consider the co-occurrences between nodes

### edge embedding with semantic label or knowledge-based annotations (somewhat pedagogical approaches for edge embedding)

##### Goal
Let we can search through our interested edge relations with semantic query which represented a bit differently. Trained with few words annotation, but finally become to be able to query "edges::to boost the political activity"
